January 2015:

To adapt NemexR to a new language, the following has to be done:

- create new parser model
- create new POS tagger model
- create new NER model
- create new language interface

- integrate new language into MDExtractor initialization

June, 2016:

- create train class that learns models for GNT and POS
	- check MDP how to call for different languages
	
- for GNT I would need language specific clusters
	- integrate Jon's clusters

- if possible train/define as many NER as possible

- define XML property file for all language resources
	and use language flag for loading models

- define uniform test function that runs NEMEX for selected language
	- fix usage of GNT and MDP
	- only NER as linguistic parameter

- check google multilingual OIE at 
	/Volumes/data2/googleMLore & neumann@lns-87009:/gfs/neumann/googleMLore/
	http://googleresearch.blogspot.de/2015/06/a-multilingual-corpus-of-automatically.html

- Can also be used for LearnExtractor -> tests its

- also use uniform morphology if possible

Data collection:
***************

I am using the same universal treebanks as Plank et al. 2016, ACL

22 different languages at: /Users/gune00/data/UniversalDependencies

Steps to do:

1. transform files from conllu to conll 
	- change .conllu to .conll 
	
	- when reading in .conllu file, ignore lines with #

2. also extract and store sentences

-> do it directly when reading the conllu files

	- specific problems:
		Italian:
			1	Sorpresa	sorpresa	NOUN	S	Gender=Fem|Number=Sing	0	root	_	_
			2-3	nella	_	_	_	_	_	_	_	_
			2	in	in	ADP	E	_	4	case	_	_
			
-> MORE issues ???
	


3. Define a generic class for calling GNT and MDP training based on generated conll data
	- use global settings for GNT-learner, so that now prop files are necessary
	-> does not work: I need dataConfig file in ZIP folder
		same as FrUniPosTagger.xml
	-> create automatically corpusConfig.xml files and dataProps files
		-> should be possible to define them as part of conll/language
		-> http://www.avajava.com/tutorials/lessons/how-do-i-write-properties-to-an-xml-file.html
	-> DONE

4. create GNT models
	- store GNT -> DONE
	- basically major problems with setting archive name and modelFileName proper and eval file name

5. Create performance output file similar to Plank et al. 2016
	- for dev/test, OOV, time, words/sec
	-> DONE for test only, because I am using static values from EvalConllFile class
		which overwrites values from dev-file
		
	- average over all languages -> DONE
	- average over selected languages
	
HIERIX

6. MDP training
	- needs as input conll train file and model file name
	- take with correct indexing of connl format in UD
		2	hatte	_	VERB	_	_	0	root	_	_
	- NOTE:
		- at least DE, IT can make problems, because
			4-5	dal	_	_	_	_	_	_	_	_
		-> adapt data reader of MDP
	
7. Update UDlanguagePerformance
